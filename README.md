# Chainlink VRF-Verified Smart Contract Lottery

This project implements a decentralized lottery system using smart contracts and Chainlink's Verifiable Random Function (VRF) for secure and provably fair random number generation.

## Overview

This smart contract lottery allows participants to enter by purchasing tickets. At the end of each lottery round, a winner is randomly selected using Chainlink VRF, ensuring a transparent and manipulation-resistant selection process.

## Features

- Decentralized lottery system
- Secure random number generation using Chainlink VRF
- Automated winner selection
- Configurable ticket price and lottery duration
- Fair and transparent process

## How It Works

1. Users purchase lottery tickets by sending ETH to the contract
2. The lottery runs for a set period
3. When the lottery period ends, the contract requests a random number from Chainlink VRF
4. Once the random number is received, a winner is selected
5. The prize pool is transferred to the winner
6. A new lottery round begins

## Technical Details

- Built with Solidity
- Uses OpenZeppelin for secure contract development
- Integrates Chainlink VRF for verifiable randomness
- Deployed on Ethereum (or specify another network)

## Setup and Deployment

(Include instructions for setting up the development environment, deploying the contract, and interacting with it)

## Testing

(Describe how to run the test suite)

## Security Considerations

- The contract has been audited by [Auditor Name] (if applicable)
- Randomness is provided by Chainlink VRF, which is cryptographically secure
- (Include any other relevant security information)
